This is a sample code for Face Recognition

We need to download/compile the following libraries:
dlib
opencv
face_recognition

Link:
https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
https://pypi.org/project/dlib/
https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/

You need Visual C++ and Cmake to compile dlib for Windows 10.

After downloading/installing these libraries, download the Face2.py, model and image folder.

Add your facial photo(s) in image folder.

Then run the program, it will load and process your newly added photos and identify you as known person.
If you do not add your photo, it will not identify you.

Thank you for reading the file.
